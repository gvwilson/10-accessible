# Ten Quick Tips for Making a Scientific Publication More Accessible

## 1. Remember that people may face many different challenges.

- Discussion of accessibiliy often focuses on vision challenges, but there are many others
- One of the authors has difficulty typing and using a mouse
- One is on the autistic spectrum
- Others may have difficulty hearing (a growing problem as video instruction becomes more common)
- Or may have anxiety, or poor comprehension of English (or whatever language you're using)

## 2. Design for print and the web.

- The paper of the future might be an interactive computational notebook, but the paper of today is still exactly that: a paper
- Even disregarding accessibility issues, saving an HTML page as a PDF usually doesn't produce an attractive result

## 3. Use tools to check for accessibility issues.

- E.g., [WebAIM WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) is a browser plugin that checks for common problems (some of which are described below)
