# Ten Quick Tips for Making a Scientific Publication More Accessible

## 1. Remember that people may face many different challenges.

- Discussion of accessibiliy often focuses on vision challenges, but there are many others
- One of the authors has difficulty typing and using a mouse
- One is on the autistic spectrum
- Others may have difficulty hearing (a growing problem as video instruction becomes more common)
- Or may have anxiety, or poor comprehension of English (or whatever language you're using)

## 2. Design for print and the web.

- The paper of the future might be an interactive computational notebook, but the paper of today is still exactly that: a paper
- Even disregarding accessibility issues, saving an HTML page as a PDF usually doesn't produce an attractive result
  (liz) use HTML, Markdown, or other formatting semantically correctly. Use headings only as headings, not as a way to emphasize text. Use tables for the display of data, but not to lay out pages.

## 3. Use tools to check for accessibility issues.

- E.g., [WebAIM WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) is a browser plugin that checks for common problems (some of which are described below)  

- (Liz) [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/improve-accessibility-with-the-accessibility-checker-a16f6de0-2f39-4a2b-8bd8-5ad801426c7f) now has accessibility checking features in Word and maybe other Office software. 

- (Liz) Understand that these tools are not infallable, and often don't point out if a page is just hard to understand the layout and logic of because a screen reader presents information linearly regardless of how it appears on the screen. Ideally, humans would be engaged in accessibility testing, but their expertise needs to be compensated.

## 4. Data visualization

- (Liz) Data Visualization has often been thought of in terms of blindness or low vision. We say that if it's too hard to write an alt-text for your graph, it's probably too complex. I've come to understand that the cognitive load of figuring out complex visualizations is also a barrier for people with neurodivergence (per conversation with Silvia Canel√≥n). 

- (Liz) Since most publishers don't have space for alt-text anyway, complete verbal descriptions of findings in the results section  is suggested (this is what I aim for in my publications, although most of them don't have data viz.) This approach will help all sorts of people. This is discussed in this preprint [Making Scientific Content More Accessible](https://www.authorea.com/users/152134/articles/206076-making-scientific-content-more-accessible)  

- (Liz) Simlarly, I think processes that are conveyed in flow charts or diagrams need to also be documented verbally in the text because it gives people more choices of ways to comprehend the material

## 5. Methods section

- (Liz) an accessible methods section has enough information for the reader to be able to replicate the study. This isn't really disability-specific. As the data person on my teams, I strive to include details about what kinds of models I used with what R packages or other software. I've worked with some statisticians who have an attitude that their work is just too specialized and complex to share in detail, and that does't help replicability or access for less senior scientists.

- (Greg) If it isn't disability-specific, I think the editors will say that it's off-topic for this particular paper.

## 6. Economic accessibility

- (Greg) If people can't afford to read the paper, it isn't "accessible". This isn't just a problem for researchers from less affluent countries: many non-elite institutions cannot afford access these days either, and practitioners outside academia usually don't have it, so open access is a must-have for true accessibility.
